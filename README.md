## Can I help you ?
### :star: Have a look at my *learning resources* about computer ?
- [MyComputerLearningResources](https://github.com/SunDocker/MyComputerLearningResources) the link to my repository that stores my learning resources
- There are ***all my notes*** about `computer learning` in this repository
### :star: Would like to see *my projects* about Java ?
- [A4Paper](https://github.com/SunDocker/A4Paper) --- An application for reciting words
- [AircraftWar](https://github.com/SunDocker/AircraftWar-base) --- A game, just like the project name (Actually it's an experiment for a course in my university)
